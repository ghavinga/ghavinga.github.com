## Gerry's first experiment using markdown


### Introduction

Apparently this can be all in markdown format. Normal paragraphs are separated with an empty line, simple markup language (not unlike Dokuwiki) is used. I am starting to love this stuff.

>  code snippets 
>  preceded with a "greater than sign"

-   Unnumbered lists
-   Preceded with an asterisk
-   or with either a "-"
-   or a "+" sign

Perhaps there should be an paragraph in between .....

1.   Numbered list 
2.   just number them .... 
3.   as easy as cake


To put links on the page, just down like this:

Text you want to make clickable, this is a good introduction yo markdown syntax: [Intro to markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Even with a title")

Should produce an HR   

An example of a reference style link:
[Reference to Swiftstack][1] 

This refers to:
[1]: http://www.swiftstack.com/ "Swiftstack's corporate web site."
(which you can't see of course ......)

This is good stuff, you could use link definitions at the end of a paragraph or even the document and refer to it indirectly. So you keep them all in one place:

[google]: http://www.google.com/ "Google's global search site."
[github]: http://www.github.com/ "Github fun."
