## Gerry's first experiment using markdown


### Introduction

Apparently this can be all in markdown format. Normal paragraphs are separated with an empty line, simple markup language (not unlike Dokuwiki) is used. I am starting to love this stuff.

* Unnumbered lists
* Preceded with an asterisk

- Numbered list, 
- precedes with either a "-"
- or a "+" sign
